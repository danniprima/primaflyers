On the following 3 pages you'll find the design for this project.
	The design is for a single list with elements that can expand and contract,
		with only one element open at a time.
	You can see that there are 2 types of items in the list, Firewall and Build

	Firewall items 
	 	can be accepted (page 1), or rejected (page2)
	 Builds 
	 	can succeed (page 3), or fail (not shown). 

	Each page showing a different element expanded 	

	Grey boxes (while not shown in the expanded state), 
		represent either 
		an item that will not run (as the entry has already failed like item 432460), 
		or 
		an item that has yet to run (as the item is currently working like item 432462) 

	when an element is in the expanded state
		each of the 4 content boxes should act as a button
			 allowing the user to get more information about that item
			 	These details will be shown in a pop-over content view on the page.
